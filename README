meta-swupdate, Yocto layer for deploy tool
==========================================

This layer's purpose is to add support for a deployment
mechanism of Yocto's images based on swupdate project.

Layer dependencies
------------------

This layer depends on:

URI: git://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded.git
subdirectory: meta-oe

Image hashing
-------------

During creation of the update file, occurrences of @IMAGE (where IMAGE is an
image filename) are replaced with the sha256 hash of the image.

SWU image signing
------------

To enable signing:
    Set SWUPDATE_SIGNING = "1"
    Set SWUPDATE_PRIVATE_KEY to the full path of private key file

sw-description is signed with the private key and the signature is writen to
sw-description.sig which is included in the SWU file.

Encrypted private keys are not currently supported since a secure 
mechanism must exist to provide the passphrase.
